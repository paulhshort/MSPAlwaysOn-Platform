## ðŸ§  Research Task:
Perform a full audit of the **Veeam Service Provider Console (VSPC)** API to understand how it can be used by MSPs for automation, monitoring, client isolation, reporting, and integrations with external platforms. Emphasize capabilities for managing tenants, jobs, alerts, usage reporting, and linking into RMMs and dashboards.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Research Instructions:

### 1. **Authentication & Session Handling**
- Detail the VSPC APIâ€™s authentication flow (OAuth2 or token-based?).
- Document token generation, expiration, and scope configuration.
- Identify multi-tenant handling and token security practices.

### 2. **API Endpoint Overview**
- Map out available endpoints and their categories:
  - Tenants
  - Backup jobs
  - Backup repositories
  - Protected workloads (M365, VM, agent-based)
  - Alerts / events
  - Reports / usage
- For each, provide:
  - Supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Common use cases
  - Example JSON request/response payloads

### 3. **Tenant & Scope Management**
- Investigate how tenants are managed via API:
  - Create/edit tenant organizations
  - Assign backup jobs, policies, quotas
  - Retrieve tenant-specific usage data
- Explore how API calls can be scoped per tenant (segregation, RBAC, etc.).

### 4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Document how to:
  - Pull alerts (job failures, license issues, repo thresholds)
  - Track job success/failure trends
  - View agent status and endpoint health
- Confirm whether alerts/events can be exported for external SOC or ticketing.

### 5. **Automation & Reporting**
- Identify available automation actions:
  - Start/stop jobs
  - Create/modify backup jobs
  - Update retention/policy settings
- Investigate data exposure for integration with:
  - Grafana (via REST/Grafana bridge)
  - BrightGauge / custom dashboards
  - ConnectWise Manage for billing automation

### 6. **API Rate Limits & Async Ops**
- Confirm if there are any rate limits or throttling behaviors.
- Analyze support for asynchronous operations (e.g. bulk job starts, status polling).
- Investigate long-running tasks and callback support.

### 7. **Third-Party Integrations**
- Research integrations or examples with:
  - IT Glue (pulling backup info into documentation)
  - CW Manage or Automate (tickets based on alerts)
  - SIEM or monitoring pipelines
- Pull any PowerShell or Python modules used in the wild for these tasks.
