## ðŸ§  Research Task:

Conduct a full technical analysis of the **UniFi Controller API** as deployed via **Hostifi**, with focus on:

- Multi-site MSP use
- API-based automation
- Monitoring and alert customization
- Integration potential with ticketing, reporting, and documentation platforms

Pay special attention to the Art-of-WiFi SDKs, and Hostifi-specific use cases for email alert rewrites, Slack integrations, and secure remote controller access.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Research Instructions:

### 1. **API Authentication & Session Management**

- Document the authentication method for UniFi APIs (typically cookie/session based).
- Explore how session tokens are acquired, refreshed, and securely stored.
- Assess the feasibility of persistent service account use in MSP automation.

### 2. **Endpoint Analysis**

Using the Art-of-WiFi API clients and UniFi official documentation, extract and categorize the following:

- Client tracking: `/api/s/<site>/stat/sta`
- Device health and status: `/api/s/<site>/stat/device`, `/stat/health`
- Configuration: `/api/s/<site>/rest/wlanconf`, `/rest/networkconf`, `/rest/firewallrule`
- Commands: `/cmd/devmgr`, `/cmd/stamgr`
- Examples to document:
  - Reboot an access point remotely
  - Rename or modify an SSID
  - Block a rogue MAC address
  - Retrieve client bandwidth usage

### 3. **Multi-Site & MSP Operations**

- Investigate how UniFi handles multi-site architecture in API requests (`/s/<site>/`).
- Explore methods to discover site IDs and how switching is managed.
- Confirm if MSP-style delegated access or site RBAC is available via API.

### 4. **Monitoring & Alerts**

- Explore how API polling can be used to monitor:
  - Offline devices
  - High client load
  - Firmware out-of-date
- Review Hostifiâ€™s guides on:
  - Slack alerting setup
  - Custom email parsing with Mailparser/Postmark
- Identify if any webhook support or alert endpoint exists.

### 5. **Integration Targets**

- Determine feasibility of integrating UniFi API data with:
  - **ConnectWise Manage** (e.g., auto-ticket for disconnected AP)
  - **IT Glue** (documenting devices per site)
  - **Grafana/Influx/Prometheus** (device health stats)
  - Email parsing tools for alert triage

### 6. **Security, Limits & Ports**

- Document which ports must be open to allow access to Hostifi cloud controllers.
- Review any known API rate limits or access throttling.
- Identify any gaps or gotchas (e.g., no native historical logging via API).
