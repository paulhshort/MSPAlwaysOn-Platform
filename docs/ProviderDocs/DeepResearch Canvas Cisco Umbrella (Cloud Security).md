## üß† Research Task:
Conduct a comprehensive and highly technical investigation of the **Cisco Umbrella** Cloud Security platform, with specific focus on its **API capabilities, data access, integration options, and automation workflows for MSPs**. Emphasize actionable insights for endpoint policy management, DNS-layer analytics, webhook usage, and multi-tenant environments.

---

## üìå Research Instructions:

### 1. **API Discovery & Architecture**
- Map the structure of the Cisco Umbrella API (Admin, Reporting, Enforcement APIs).
- Break down the base URLs, endpoint structure, and API versions.
- For each endpoint group (e.g. `destinations`, `identities`, `policies`, `activity-reports`, etc):
  - Document all available HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Identify required and optional parameters.
  - Provide example JSON payloads for both request and response.
  - Include use-case examples for common MSP tasks (e.g., adding block destinations, pulling user activity logs).

### 2. **Authentication & API Key Handling**
- Explain how Admin API keys are created and scoped.
- Detail the authentication flow (header structure, expiration, renewal).
- Include security recommendations from Cisco on storing and rotating keys.
- Determine if granular scope/tenant-based key management is possible.

### 3. **Data Access & Reporting**
- Identify all types of data available via the Umbrella APIs:
  - DNS queries and threats blocked.
  - Activity history for roaming clients.
  - Policy enforcement logs.
  - Destination allow/block lists.
- Explore how data can be exported for logging, SOC dashboards, or compliance.
- Look for compatibility or examples with SIEM ingestion or integration with Grafana.

### 4. **Automation & Webhooks**
- Research if Cisco Umbrella supports real-time webhooks or event-based triggers.
- Investigate polling endpoints for periodic task automation.
- Find PowerShell, Python, or Postman libraries/modules used for automating policy management.

### 5. **Multi-Tenant MSP Use Case Support**
- Identify any native support for multi-org management under a single MSP login or API key.
- Determine how to scope data or policies per client org via API.
- Look into provisioning new organizations or managing delegated clients programmatically.

### 6. **Third-Party Integrations & Use Cases**
- Identify common integrations between Cisco Umbrella and:
  - RMMs like ConnectWise RMM
  - PSA systems like ConnectWise Manage
  - Documentation platforms like IT Glue
- Find GitHub repos or scripts with MSP-oriented workflows (e.g., bulk client DNS policy import/export, reporting automation).
