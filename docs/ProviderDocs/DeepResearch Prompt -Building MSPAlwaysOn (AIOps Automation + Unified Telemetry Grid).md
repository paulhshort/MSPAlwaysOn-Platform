##  **DeepResearch Prompt: Building MSPAlwaysOn (AIOps Automation + Unified Telemetry Grid)**

**Goal:**  
You are building a modular, extensible, multi-tenant platform called **MSPAlwaysOn** (aka AIOps Grid). This platform should ingest telemetry, operational data, and alerts from across the entire MSP stack. It must support **agentic operations** â€” enabling both **automated actions** (e.g., ticket creation, endpoint remediation, backup validation) and **reactive workflows** based on real-time or predictive data (e.g., threat rollbacks, SLA escalations, device isolation).

The architecture must unify disparate tools, support data normalization, and expose a **semantic query layer and unified API**. It should power:

- Executive and technical dashboards

- Alert correlation & noise reduction

- ML-driven event forecasting and SLA tracking

- Automation triggers for ticketing, remediation, and documentation

---

### ðŸ”§ **Platforms in Scope for Integration / Data Ingestion / Automation**

You **must design for** integration with the following platforms, all of which either offer APIs or telemetry:

**PSA / RMM / Client Portal**

- ConnectWise Manage (ticketing, SLAs, agreements, contacts, companies)

- ConnectWise RMM (Asio) (agent health, alerts, remediation)

- ConnectWise Control (remote session history)

- DeskDirector (ticketing interface, client actions) - Ideally what we build could contribute to eliminating Desk Director

**Security & EDR**

- SentinelOne MDR (agent state, threat events, remediation capabilities)

- Cisco Umbrella (DNS activity, security policies)

**Network & Infra Monitoring**

- Auvik (Alerts, interface/device status, topology)

- UniFi Controller via Hostifi (AP status, client metrics, firmware state)

**Backup & Continuity**

- Veeam VSPC / Cloud Connect (job status, repo stats, tenant backup reporting)

- Cove Backup (lightweight M365 + endpoint BDR jobs)

**M365 & Identity**

- CIPP (M365 tenant and user/license management, MFA state)

- IT Glue (documentation, password storage, config data, asset metadata)
- AppRiver (M365 licensing)

**Email Security**

- Proofpoint Essentials (email threat telemetry, spam quarantine)



**Reporting / Feedback**

- BrightGauge (dashboarding layer)<<< Ideally what we are building will get rid of the need for BrightGauge

- SmileBack (CSAT results)

**Storage**

- Wasabi (offsite S3 storage for BDR workloads but can be used to store other data for our project)

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Platform Requirements**

The architecture should support the following functional domains:

#### 1. Data Collection & Telemetry Ingestion

- Ability to pull from REST APIs (JSON), Webhooks, SNMP, file drops, or scheduled exports

- Support for historical polling and real-time change feeds

- Secure authentication storage and token rotation logic

#### 2. Data Modeling & Semantic Layer

- Normalize and standardize telemetry across domains (EDR, backup, PSA, network)

- Create unified, human-readable schemas for queries and dashboards

- Enable tenant-specific views and RBAC

#### 3. Agentic Orchestration & Actioning

- Support playbooks or workflows that:
  
  - Trigger actions (e.g., isolate endpoint, restart AP, create CW ticket, run CIPP job)
  
  - Enforce policies (e.g., alert on backup failure + check if covered by Veeam or Cove)
  
  - Log changes back to IT Glue or CW Manage

#### 4. Query & API Unification

- Unified SQL layer across multi-source data (OSS: Trino/Dremio; Azure: Synapse Serverless)

- Optionally expose a GraphQL or REST API for internal tools

#### 5. Automation & Event Stream Handling

- Enable real-time alert handling, streaming logs, status changes

- Compare streaming stacks: Apache Kafka, Pulsar, Flink vs Azure Event Hub, Stream Analytics

#### 6. Visualization & Frontend

- Support both internal dashboards and client-facing views

- Compare Power BI, Grafana, Apache Superset, Microsoft Fabric dashboards

- Embed dashboards securely into portals like DeskDirector

#### 7. AI/ML & AIOps Capabilities

- Use-case-driven forecasting, pattern detection, alert enrichment

- Compare OSS ML frameworks (Feast, MLflow) vs Azure ML, Synapse ML, Cognitive Services

- Example use cases: backup failure prediction, alert deduplication, client risk scoring
