## 🔍 Deep Research Prompt: MSP AI Ops Automation Suite

### Objective
Conduct an in-depth analysis and development plan for enhancing the [ConnectWise AI Copilot](https://github.com/paulhshort/connectwise-ai-copilot) projectThe goal is to evolve it into a robust MSP AI Ops Automation Suite capable of intelligent alert management, monitoring, and reporting across various MSP platforms

### Current Project Overview
The existing [ConnectWise AI Copilot](https://github.com/paulhshort/connectwise-ai-copilot) project serves as a foundation, integrating AI capabilities with ConnectWise ManageIt utilizes modern technologies such as React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI for the frontend, and incorporates Azure AD authentication using MSALReal-time features are implemented using Server-Sent Events (SSE), and state management is handled by ZustandThe project also includes a centralized API client and caching mechanisms

### Research and Development Goals

1. **Unified Data Intake and Management**
   -Integrate multiple shared mailboxes and webhooks for alert retrieval from platforms like SentinelOne SOC, Cisco Umbrella, Backup Jobs, and Microsoft 365
   -Implement real-time data ingestion through robust APIs, such as CIPP API and other security and IT management platforms
   -Establish a scalable system for categorizing, storing, and managing alerts for easy retrieval and historical analysis

2. **AI-Powered Intelligent Agents**
   -Develop specialized AI agents assigned to specific alert types and monitoring responsibilities
   -Automate functions such as initial parsing of alert data, severity assessment, criticality rating, and preliminary troubleshooting
   -Facilitate automated escalation protocols, delivering critical notifications through integration with Microsoft Teams, SMS, and automated voice calls

3. **Centralized Interactive Dashboard**
   -Establish a dynamic dashboard using Azure Static Web Apps or Linux servers within VMware infrastructure
   -Enable customizable real-time visual representations via gauges and indicators for monitoring metrics at device, client, and incident-specific levels
   -Provide advanced analytics and historical reporting for trend analysis, predictive insights, and strategic decision-making

4. **Dynamic Reporting and Notifications**
   -Automate the generation and delivery of customized monthly reports that surpass standard reports from platforms like BrightGauge
   -Implement proactive and intelligent notifications, leveraging personalized messaging and role-specific communication styles through sophisticated voice agents
   -Offer drill-down capabilities for detailed exploration of report metrics and event histories directly from the dashboard interface

5. **Integration and Automation**
   -Seamlessly integrate with ConnectWise Manage and Automate to centralize and streamline MSP operations
   -Automate the creation of support tickets enriched with detailed contextual information from intelligent analysis of incoming alerts
   -Enable AI-driven assignment and prioritization of tickets, considering real-time team member availability, expertise, and workload

### Recommended Frameworks and Libraries

- **Firebase Studio**:For rapid prototyping, real-time database operations, authentication, and serverless functions
- **RooCode**:A next-gen coding assistant that uses contextual AI to help create full-stack apps with minimal boilerplate
- **AugmentCode**:An AI-assisted code refactoring and generation platform focusing on scaling up dev teams
- **GitHub Copilot Agents**:Provides an automated assistant for repetitive coding tasks, error-fixing, and documentation
